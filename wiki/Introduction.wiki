= Introduction = 

Machete is a web application that manages a day labor referral service. Machete tracks work orders for employers looking for short term, casual labor. It also provides a means for matching laborers with specific skills to requests made by employers for skilled labor.

== What Machete does ==

Machete performs the following tasks:
 # Stores basic contact information for all persons associated with the Machete system 
 # Stores biographical and membership information on its members 
 # Records member sign-in using a identification number through either a bar code scanner or the keyboard 
 # Captures employer, work order, and work assignment details into a relational database 
 # Provides a fast, flexible method of dispatching workers to work orders based on English level, skill level, and employer requests 
 # Captures events such as worker recommendations, complaints, sanctions, and expulsion

== How Machete works ==

Machete is a web application, meaning that it web server connected to a datbase. The web server interacts with a web  client (FireFox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari) to provide the application functionality. The web client/server framework provides a great deal of flexibility, but also comes with its own quirks and restraints.

== Logging into Machete ==

Because Machete is a web application, it can be setup on any Microsoft Web Server (IIS). To access Machete, use a compliant web browser and use it to go to the Machete web server:
The default is: http://machete/
You will need a login and password to sign in to Machete. You can register for an account by clicking in the Logon link in the upper right hand corner of the Machete page. A manager or dispatcher will need to give your account permission to use Machete.

== What Machete does not do ==

Reports. Machete captures data, display data, and prints select data through the web clientâ€™s print functionality.  
Reports on the data that Machete collects are available through any SQL-compliant tool.
A set of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports are provided, but SSRS is a separate component, not available with the free verson of SQL Server.
Note: Microsoft Reporting & Analysis Service will be used to provide report access. Reports can be found at http://machete/reports/
