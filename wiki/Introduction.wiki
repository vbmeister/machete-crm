= Introduction = 

Machete is a web application that manages a day labor referral service. Machete tracks work orders for employers looking for short term, casual labor. It also provides a means for matching laborers with specific skills to requests made by employers for skilled labor.

== The Basics ==
=== What Machete does ===

Machete performs the following tasks:
 # Stores basic contact information for all persons associated with the Machete system 
 # Stores biographical and membership information on its members 
 # Records member sign-in using a identification number through either a bar code scanner or the keyboard 
 # Captures employer, work order, and work assignment details into a relational database 
 # Provides a fast, flexible method of dispatching workers to work orders based on English level, skill level, and employer requests 
 # Captures events such as worker recommendations, complaints, sanctions, and expulsion

=== How Machete works ===

Machete is a web application, meaning that it web server connected to a datbase. The web server interacts with a web  client (FireFox, Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari) to provide the application functionality. The web client/server framework provides a great deal of flexibility, but also comes with its own quirks and restraints.

=== Logging into Machete ===

Because Machete is a web application, it can be setup on any Microsoft Web Server (IIS). To access Machete, use a compliant web browser and use it to go to the Machete web server:
The default is: http://machete/
You will need a login and password to sign in to Machete. You can register for an account by clicking in the Logon link in the upper right hand corner of the Machete page. A manager or dispatcher will need to give your account permission to use Machete.

=== What Machete does not do ===

Reports. Machete captures data, display data, and prints select data through the web clientâ€™s print functionality.  
Reports on the data that Machete collects are available through any SQL-compliant tool.
A set of SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) reports are provided, but SSRS is a separate component, not available with the free verson of SQL Server.
Note: Microsoft Reporting & Analysis Service will be used to provide report access. Reports can be found at http://machete/reports/

=== Terminology ===

Within Machete there are some terms that have a specific meaning.
 * *Persons:* A person record contains basic information on persons in Machete.
 * *Workers:* A worker record is a companion to the person record and is linked to the person record. 
 * *Employers:* An employer record  is a person or business that calls to hire a worker. 
 * *Work Orders:* A work order record is a request by an employer for one or more workers.
   * *Pending Orders:* A pending order is a new order, or an incomplete order, or an order not yet marked active. 
   * *Active Orders:* An active order is an order that has at least one work assignment and has been marked active.
   * *Complete Orders:* A complete order has had all of it's assignments filled with workers and marked as complete. 
   * *Cancelled Orders:* Orders cancelled by the employer
   * *Expired Orders:* Orders that could not be fulfilled (either because no worker was available, or no worker with the specific skill required could be found in time for the job).
 * *Work Assignment:* A work assignment is part of a work order. One  assignment is created for each worker needed. 
 * *Dispatch:* Dispatch is the process of assigning a worker who has signed-in for the day to an active work assignment.
 * *Worker Sign-in:* A sign-in occurs when a worker signs in to Machete. A sign-in is required for the worker to appear in the Machete Dispatch page.
 * *Skills:* Every work assignment requires the selection of the skills necessary to complete the work. Some skills are general skills, such as digging, that any worker can fulfill. Other skills are specialty skills, which limit which workers are eligible to be assigned to the work assignment.

==The Machete Interface==
===Navigation===
The diagram below identifies common components of the machete interface.
[http://machete-crm.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Introduction_Navigation-1.png]

===Menu Links===
Every Machete page has a row of gray boxes, the Menu Links, that contain HTML links. These links go to different Machete pages, providing access to various areas of the application.
The links cause the browser to load a new HTML page. The links divide the major areas of Machete functionality. Clicking on the link for the page you are already viewing will cause the page to be re-loaded.

===Tabs===
Machete uses tabs to divide different areas of functinality. When records are opened, a new tab is opened to display the information. Moving away from a tab will cause a new tab to be re-loaded. If you return to the previous tab, it will also be re-loaded. The tabs are re-loaded intentionally to make sure information is current.

===List Tab===
The List Tab is the default tab for most Machete pages. The list tab shows a list of a given page's records and provides search and sorting features against the records. 
Once a record is found that needs to be edited or printed, double-click on the record row in the list tab. A record tab will open to the right, with identifying information in the tab's text box.
The lists are implemented with an open source add-on called datatables and can be found at [http://www.datatables.net/ DataTables.net].

===Search Box===
The search box automatically searches the list of records for text as it's being entered. There is a 400 ms second delay on searching, to reduce load on the Machete database. Most fields displayed in a list will be searched, with the exception of 'Updated by' fields. These fields are seldom searched and increase search load for all searches, so they are excluded.

===Create Tab===
The Create Tab is available for almost all pages. The create tab provides a blank record for entering new information. The save button must be used to save the new record to the database. 
It is important to note that for most Machete operations, there are a series of records that must be created, in succession, in order to complete a task. In such situations, creating a record will open up a new set of tabs. This new set of tabs will have a List tab and a Create Tab that function in the same manner as their parent.

===Record Tab===
When a record is created using the Create tab and saved, a new tab will be opened. Record tabs can also be opened by double clicking on a record row in a List tab.
Record tabs allow a user to edit or delete a record. The delete functionality should be used carefully, because it may also delete related records. There is no undelete functionality; deletions are permanent.

===Table entries per page===
This option controls how many rows are displayed in a table at a given time. The default number is set relatively low because it reduces processing load and time on the server.

===Pagination===
The pagination arrows move through pages of table data. Each click will make a call to the database to fetch a new set of records to display in the table.

===Language===
The language links tell Machete which language to display for the pages. Currently Spanish and English are the languages available for Machete.

===Required fields===
Some fields are required in order to save a record. If a user attempts to save the record without filling out a required field, the field is highlighted in red and an error message is displayed.

Required fields exist to ensure that all necessary information for processing an order or managing a worker is collected. 

==Pages of Machete==
The pages of Machete correspond to the major functions that it performs. However, the organization may not be intuitive based on the names alone.

===Employers===
The employers page provides access for searching, creating, editing, and deleting employer records. It is also the page that provides access for creating work orders and work assignments. The work order and work assignment creation is embedded in the employer page because such actions are always employer-specific. 

===Work Orders===
The work order page provides summary and management functionality for work orders. It does not provide creation functionality--see employers. 

===Dispatch===
The dispatch page brings together the list of workers signed in to Machete for the day and the list of work assignments that need to be filled. The page provides several methods of filtering the lists to find workers with skills necessary for an assignment. It also provides an interface for recording lottery selections using a bar code scanner.

===Persons===
The persons page provides access for searching, creating, editing, and deleting person records. It also provides access for creating worker records. This functionality is located in the person page (and not the workers page) because a person record must be created first. A worker record is created afterward.

===Workers===
The workers page provides access for searching, editing, and deleting worker records. The worker page allows users to search by worker membership number. 

===Worker Sign-in===
The worker sign-in page records daily registration of workers. The page can be used with a bar-code scanner, or the membership number of the worker can be entered using the keyboard. 

==User Accounts==
To access Machete, a user must create a user account AND be granted privileges to access the system by an Administrator.  
The user creation process prompts the user to give their real first and last name. Using a real first and last name is important because this name is also part of the logging system. The name of the user is logged whenever he or she makes a change to a record.
When a user is not logged in, [Logon] is displayed in the upper right hand corner of every page. If the user does not have an account, a Register link is available from the logon page.

Bilingual Support
Machete has the capability to support muliple display languages. As of Summer 2011, it supports English and Spanish. More languages can be added.
The links to switch between English and Spanish are in the upper right hand corner of every page. A user can switch between English and Spanish anywhere in the application.

Work Flow
The diagram below illustrates the basic work flow of creating orders in Machete. Creating a work order involves an employer record, a work order record, and at least one work assignment record. At the end of the process, the users signifies that the order is complete by activating the order. 
Active orders are visible in the Dispatch page and are able to be assigned workers.

The following pages will discuss the pages of Machete that provide this functionality.
