=The Machete Interface=

The diagram below identifies common components of the machete interface.

==Menu Links==
Every Machete page has a row of gray boxes, the Menu Links, that contain HTML links. These links go to different Machete pages, providing access to various areas of the application.
The links cause the browser to load a new HTML page. The links divide the major areas of Machete functionality. Clicking on the link for the page you are already viewing will cause the page to be re-loaded.

==Tabs==
Machete uses tabs to divide different areas of functinality. When records are opened, a new tab is opened to display the information. Moving away from a tab will cause a new tab to be re-loaded. If you return to the previous tab, it will also be re-loaded. The tabs are re-loaded intentionally to make sure information is current.

==List Tab==
The List Tab is the default tab for most Machete pages. The list tab shows a list of a given page's records and provides search and sorting features against the records. 
Once a record is found that needs to be edited or printed, double-click on the record row in the list tab. A record tab will open to the right, with identifying information in the tab's text box.
The lists are implemented with an open source add-on called datatables and can be found at [http://www.datatables.net/ DataTables.net].

==Search Box==
The search box automatically searches the list of records for text as it's being entered. There is a 400 ms second delay on searching, to reduce load on the Machete database. Most fields displayed in a list will be searched, with the exception of 'Updated by' fields. These fields are seldom searched and increase search load for all searches, so they are excluded.

==Create Tab==
The Create Tab is available for almost all pages. The create tab provides a blank record for entering new information. The save button must be used to save the new record to the database. 
It is important to note that for most Machete operations, there are a series of records that must be created, in succession, in order to complete a task. In such situations, creating a record will open up a new set of tabs. This new set of tabs will have a List tab and a Create Tab that function in the same manner as their parent.

==Record Tab==
When a record is created using the Create tab and saved, a new tab will be opened. Record tabs can also be opened by double clicking on a record row in a List tab.
Record tabs allow a user to edit or delete a record. The delete functionality should be used carefully, because it may also delete related records. There is no undelete functionality; deletions are permanent.

==Table entries per page==
This option controls how many rows are displayed in a table at a given time. The default number is set relatively low because it reduces processing load and time on the server.

==Pagination==
The pagination arrows move through pages of table data. Each click will make a call to the database to fetch a new set of records to display in the table.

==Language==
The language links tell Machete which language to display for the pages. Currently Spanish and English are the languages available for Machete.

==Required fields==
Some fields are required in order to save a record. If a user attempts to save the record without filling out a required field, the field is highlighted in red and an error message is displayed.

Required fields exist to ensure that all necessary information for processing an order or managing a worker is collected.
